                    Once I entered my 30s I suddenly started noticeing my body more, at least in the negative sort of way. This soul carrier of mine which had previously done its duty without much malign, started showing signs of wear and tear. As a result, annoying little aches and pains began following me around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What to do I wondered? I mean, I am a desk worker. How much wear and tear get you really get from that? So, I did what many would do. I bought myself a red sports car and lived happily ever after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, that would have been one way. Lacking the proper funds for this approach I went the "healthier living" and "more workout" route. I am not going to talk much about healthier living here, and focus instead on the workout portion. After all, I just wrote an <a href="http://appletes.net" target="_blank">App</a> for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel that have a lot going on in my life. There are many things and people wandering into my field of vision every day, to try and catch my attention, or drag me this way or that. So, finding time was of the essence and I soon realized that going to the Gym on the other side of town, even 3 times a week, was not sustainable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I got myself some Kettlebells and a Yoga mat, and put them into my Garage - I think they are still in there somewhere. Clearly, working out heroically, yet lonely, in my garage was not going to hold my interest for the long haul. However, it had also become clear to me, that physical exercise had to be a continous quest in my life in order to extend the kind of personal well-being I wanted to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In came High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), or Tabata, or whatever people chose to call it. Instead of slogging along on a treadmill for 45 minutes, these are burst-like, sets of bodyweight exercises that are performed back to back and last between 10 and 30 minutes in all. This can be done in your gym OR in your garage. However, I wanted to save myself a trip to the gym, yet still get motivation and have feedback from other humans. So, what has worked best to consistently keep me engaged and feeling good, has been working out through a social fitness app on my phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is also the idea behind <strong><a href="http://appletes.net" target="_blank">Appletes</a></strong>, a <strong><i>health and fitness focused crowd sourcing platform for people on the go</i></strong>. It is meant to incorporate the best of HIIT and social fitness Apps by infinitely expanding the variety of exercises that can be performed, through the power of the human being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also find <strong>Appletes</strong> in my <a href="index.html#projects">Projects</a> section here on the site. It is still in Alpha but please feel free to tweet me constructive feedback and suggestions <a href="https://twitter.com/pixeloon" target="_blank">@pixeloon</a>.
